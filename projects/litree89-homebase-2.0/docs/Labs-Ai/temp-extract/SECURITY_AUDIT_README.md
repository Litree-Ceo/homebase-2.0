❌ **Don't bypass authentication** - Even for "internal" routes

### What TO Do

✅ **Review all changes** - Get peer review on security fixes  
✅ **Test thoroughly** - Both positive and negative cases  
✅ **Document decisions** - Why you chose specific approaches  
✅ **Follow the plan** - The action plan is comprehensive
